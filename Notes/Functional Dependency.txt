**Functional Dependency Notes**
-------------------------------

- FD can be determined by checking two conditions:

--> FD : X --> Y  
    if   t1.x == t2.x
    then t1.y == t2.y

--> if you found that column X is all unique and doesn't have duplicates then, X & Y are functionally dependent and no need to check for the second condition.
